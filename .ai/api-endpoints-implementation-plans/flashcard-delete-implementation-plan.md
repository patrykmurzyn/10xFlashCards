# API Endpoint Implementation Plan: Delete a Flashcard

## 1. Endpoint Overview

This endpoint allows an authenticated user to permanently delete a flashcard. The endpoint leverages Supabase with RLS policies to ensure that users can only delete their own flashcards, in accordance with our tech stack and implementation rules (@tech-stack.md, @shared.mdc, @backend.mdc).

## 2. Request Details

- **Method:** DELETE
- **URL Structure:** `/api/flashcards/{id}`
- **Parameters:**
  - **Required:**
    - `id` (Path Parameter): UUID of the flashcard to be deleted.
- **Request Body:** None

## 3. Utilized Types

- No specific DTO is required as deletion only requires the flashcard ID from the URL.

## 4. Response Details

- **Success Response (204 No Content):**
  - The flashcard is successfully deleted with no content returned.
- **Error Responses:**
  - **401 Unauthorized:** Returned if the user is not authenticated.
  - **404 Not Found:** Returned if the flashcard is not found or does not belong to the authenticated user.
  - **500 Internal Server Error:** Returned for unexpected server-side errors.

## 5. Data Flow

1. **Client Request:** The client sends a DELETE request to `/api/flashcards/{id}` with the flashcard UUID as a path parameter.
2. **Middleware Authentication:** Middleware validates the user's JWT token to ensure they are authenticated.
3. **Service Layer:** The flashcard service verifies that the flashcard belongs to the authenticated user using Supabase RLS policies.
4. **Deletion Operation:** The service performs the deletion operation on the database.
5. **Response:** If deletion is successful, a 204 No Content response is returned; otherwise, an appropriate error response is sent.

## 6. Security Considerations

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Validate the JWT token and ensure the flashcard belongs to the authenticated user.
- **RLS Policies:** Use Supabase RLS to prevent deletion of flashcards that do not belong to the user.
- **Input Validation:** Ensure that the `id` parameter is a valid UUID.

## 7. Error Handling

- **404 Not Found:** Returned if the flashcard does not exist or does not belong to the user.
- **401 Unauthorized:** Returned if the JWT token is missing or invalid.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** Returned for unexpected errors such as database connection issues. Errors should be logged securely.

## 8. Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Query:** Use optimized database queries to perform the deletion operation with minimal latency.
- **Indexing:** Ensure that necessary indexes exist on `id` and `user_id` for efficient lookup and deletion.

## 9. Implementation Steps

1. **Create the Route Handler:**
   - Implement the DELETE handler in `src/pages/api/flashcards/[id].ts`.
2. **Validate Input Data:**
   - Validate the `id` parameter to confirm it is a valid UUID.
3. **Authenticate User:**
   - Use middleware to verify the user's authentication status and extract user information.
4. **Perform the Deletion:**
   - Execute the deletion query via Supabase, ensuring that the flashcard belongs to the authenticated user (using RLS).
5. **Return the Response:**
   - Return a 204 No Content response if deletion is successful.
   - Return a 404 Not Found response if the flashcard is not found.
6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Log any errors and return the appropriate HTTP status codes (401, 404, or 500) as needed.
