# API Endpoint Implementation Plan: Get a Single Flashcard

## 1. Endpoint Overview

This endpoint provides a way for an authenticated user to retrieve details of a single flashcard. It uses HTTP GET and returns a JSON payload containing flashcard data. The endpoint leverages Supabase for data access (with RLS policies), and follows the provided tech stack and implementation rules (@tech-stack.md, @shared.mdc, @backend.mdc).

## 2. Request Details

- **Method:** GET
- **URL Structure:** `/api/flashcards/{id}`
- **Parameters:**
  - **Required:**
    - `id` (Path Parameter): UUID of the flashcard to retrieve.
  - **Optional:** None
- **Request Body:** None

## 3. Utilized Types

- **DTO:** `FlashcardDTO` (@types) â€“ represents the flashcard data to be exposed to the client.
- **Other References:**
  - Type definitions for flashcards and related entities are defined in `src/types.ts`.

## 4. Response Details

- **Success Response (200 OK):** Returns a JSON object representing the flashcard data (fields include `id`, `front`, `back`, `source`, `generation_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`).
- **Error Responses:**
  - **401 Unauthorized:** The user is not authenticated or token is invalid.
  - **404 Not Found:** The flashcard does not exist or does not belong to the authenticated user.
  - **500 Internal Server Error:** An unexpected error occurred on the server.

## 5. Data Flow

1. **Client Request:** The client sends a GET request to `/api/flashcards/{id}` with the flashcard UUID in the URL.
2. **Middleware Authentication:** A middleware validates the JWT token ensuring that the user is authenticated.
3. **Service Layer:** A flashcard service (either new or integrated into an existing service) retrieves the flashcard from the database using the provided `id`, ensuring the flashcard belongs to the authenticated user (leveraging RLS in Supabase).
4. **Response:** If the flashcard is found, its details are returned as a JSON response. Otherwise, appropriate error responses (404 or 500) are generated.

## 6. Security Considerations

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Ensure that the user's JWT is validated. Use Supabase RLS policies to make sure that only flashcards belonging to the user are accessible.
- **Parameter Validation:** Validate the `id` parameter to ensure it is a valid UUID. Use a Zod schema (or similar validator) for input validation.
- **Error Logging:** Log errors securely (excluding sensitive data) to assist with debugging while not exposing sensitive information to the client.

## 7. Error Handling

- **400 Bad Request:** Not commonly used here since the only input is the path parameter, but can be returned if the `id` is not a valid UUID.
- **401 Unauthorized:** Returned if the authentication token is missing or invalid.
- **404 Not Found:** Returned when no flashcard matching the given `id` is found for the authenticated user.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** Returned when an unexpected error occurs (e.g., database connection issues).

## 8. Performance Considerations

- **Indexing:** Ensure indexes exist on `flashcards.id` and `flashcards.user_id` for fast look-ups.
- **Efficient Queries:** Use optimized SQL queries (or Supabase client queries) that only fetch necessary fields.
- **Caching:** Consider caching mechanisms if the endpoint becomes a performance bottleneck, though for single resource retrieval this is less critical.

## 9. Implementation Steps

1. **Create the Route Handler:**
   - Implement the GET handler in `src/pages/api/flashcards/[id].ts`.
2. **Validate Input:**
   - Validate the `id` parameter (using a UUID validation method or a Zod schema).
3. **Authenticate User:**
   - Retrieve and validate authenticated user information from the request context.
4. **Fetch Flashcard Data:**
   - Query the flashcards table using the provided `id`, ensuring the record belongs to the authenticated user via Supabase RLS.
5. **Return Response:**
   - If the flashcard is found, return a 200 OK response with the flashcard data in JSON format.
   - If the flashcard is not found, return a 404 Not Found response.
6. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Log any errors encountered during the process and return a 500 Internal Server Error for unexpected issues.
