# Test Plan for 10xFlashCards

## 1. Introduction and Test Objectives

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the 10xFlashCards application, a web application designed to streamline the creation of educational flashcards using Language Models (LLMs). The primary objectives of testing are to:

- Ensure all core functionalities work as expected
